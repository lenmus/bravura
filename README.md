# bravura: Bravura SMuFL font package for LenMus projects

Bravura is an OpenType music font designed by Daniel Spreadbury at Steinberg.

It is the reference font for Standard Music Font Layout
([SMuFL](http://www.smufl.org/)) project, which provides a standard way of mapping the
thousands of musical symbols required by conventional music notation into the
Private Use Area in Unicode’s Basic Multilingual Plane for a
single (format-independent) font.

As not all distros have packages for this font, this repo contains the Bravura
font for LenMus projects. The Steinberg's repo at
